We should say 'I watched Inception last night' because it happened in the past. Also, we can say 'It was very confusing but interesting.' Now, what aspect of the movie did you find most intriguing?"

        "input": "The dreams in dreams was hard to follow, but effects amazing.",
        "response": "Great observation! Let's refine your sentence: 'The dreams within dreams were hard to follow, but the effects were amazing.' We use 'were' because 'dreams' is plural. Also, don't forget 'the' before 'effects'. Can you describe a specific scene with impressive effects?"
